# Kaggle-Housing-Prices-Prediction
Project for the Kaggle Housing Prices Competition, starting from a baseline template and progressively developed through my own experiments and improvements.

# Competition Overview
The task was to use machine learning to predict housing prices from a training dataset and apply the model to a test dataset.
